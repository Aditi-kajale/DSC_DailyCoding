Q1)Maximum subarray sum in an array created after repeated concatenation

Given an array and a number k, find the largest sum of contiguous array in the modified array which is formed by repeating the given array k times.
Input  : arr[] = {-1, 10, 20}, k = 2
Output : 59
After concatenating array twice, we 
get {-1, 10, 20, -1, 10, 20} which has 
maximum subarray sum as 59.

Input  : arr[] = {-1, -2, -3}, k = 3
Output : -1
