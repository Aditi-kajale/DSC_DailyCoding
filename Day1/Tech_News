Jio continues to raise big money from global tech firms; here's what makes it attractive.

Jio, the telecom provider firm owned by the billionaire Mukesh Ambani is attracting investments from top global tech firms. The company has just raised Rs 2,624 crore from Intel Capital and Qualcomm Asia Pacific.

Jio is already supported by the largest tech firms in the world. The company has raised $6 billion for 9.9% from Facebook in April. Even Google has acquired a 7.7% stake in Jio by paying $4.5 billion. This is the first time an Indian company has attracted this level of attention from global tech players.

The telecom operator has revolutionized the mobile internet in India. Ever since it's been launched, Jio has helped in connecting even rural India with the high-speed internet.

Covid-19 pandemic has hastened India's transition to a digital economy. The data by the Reserve Bank of India suggests that India records 100 million digital transactions each day. Jio has played a big role in this transition.

The aggressive pricing and scrutiny of US tech rivals have helped Jio in reaching where it is today. The platform has enabled a billion users to use the internet. It has evolved as an online marketplace of consumers which is a big boost for the app economy. Jio has further opened doors for various consumer needs.

The primary reason why big tech firms are betting on Jio is because of its reach. The deep integration in the communication sector will help Jio grow its digital and services platforms.

India has always been an important market for the largest tech companies in the world. However, the hints of upcoming regulatory hurdles can block the growth of these companies in India. Jio can help its investor tech firms to navigate through these regulatory hurdles.
